## Read To Me App

A reading fluency website for school-aged children to record video and audio of themselves reading text passages to increase their reading fluency, built using Python, Flask, MySQL, & APIs.

#### Goals: 

As a former elementary teacher specializing in reading and ESOL, I designed this app with 3 goals in mind: 

  1. Student Centric

     It is standard for schools to assign students 20 minutes of reading homework each night. Most students do not have a parent who can read or assist them in their reading during that 20 minutes. I wanted to build an app that put the power of partner reading in the hands of the student: reading and listening to themselves.
    
  2. Fluency Focused
  
     I wanted the app to focus on reading fluency: an aspect of literacy often overlooked in traditional reading apps and standardized reading curriculum. This app promotes fluency allowing the student to record their audio and video ... and then play it back to be able to self-assess their fluency and make self-directed adjustments in a low-stakes environment.
    
  3. Easy Navigation: 
  
     I wanted the app to be easy to navigate since it's designed for students who need additional reading help such as those with Dyslexia, English Language Learners (ELLs), below grade level readers, and more! 



  Why Fluency? In my research prior to wireframing this app, I found there were many apps that promote reading and overall literacy for children, but one of the major areas of literacy: fluency, was ignored. Fluency focuses on the enunciation, pronunication, and prosody (i.e. speed) with which someone reads a text. 


#### Implementation: 

  - Implemented MediaCapture API, MediaRecorder API, and Streams API for video and audio recording and playback. 
  - Designed database using MySQL to ensure only registered and logged in users have access to recording features.
  - Conceptualized project using Trello and followed the Agile Development Process to create an MVP to go live with. 
  - Researched WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards to assist struggling readers in easily navigating the user interface.


#### Biggest Hurdle: 

  My initial goal for the app included adding in an API for pronunciation that would score the child's audio recording. It would require storing the recording, limiting the length of the recording, providing the passages to the API's AI prior to the child's selection of the passage, and then reporting the scoring. This feature is still being researched, but in the meantime, I was able to implement APIs that allow screen recording and audio capture which has the benefit of giving the child the ability to watch themselves reading vs only hearing their audio. 


#### Timeline & Role: 

  - One week to come up with idea, wireframe it, and create MVP to complete the Python Stack of my coursework at Coding Dojo full-time software development program. 
  - This was a solo, personal project, where I was the Full-Stack Developer.
